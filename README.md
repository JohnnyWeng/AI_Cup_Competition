### Project description
In this project, we participated in the AI Cup, a competition to predict solar PV output using regional microclimate data.
Solar PV output is influenced by radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind, while dust and rainfall further impact system performance.
Given the complex topography of Hualien, we deployed sensors across various terrains alongside PV modules to collect localized microclimate data and record power output.
The competition provided 2024 data from 17 sites for model training, and the task was to predict power output at specified times and locations, with ranking based on prediction error.
### Result
We achieved 96th place out of 944 teams, placing within the top 10% of all participants.
